/**
 * This class is part of the "World of Zuul" application. 
 * "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  
 *
 * This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user.
 * A command currently consists of two strings: a command word and a second
 * word (for example, if the command was "take map", then the two strings
 * obviously are "take" and "map").
 * 
 * The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid
 * command words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not
 * known) then the command word is <null>.
 *
 * If the command had only one word, then the second word is <null>.
 *

 * 19. Applying MVC to your text-based adventure game would involve organizing 
 * the game's data (like player stats and inventory)
 * as the Model, the game's textual outputs as the View, 
 * and the logic that processes user commands as the Controller. 
 * This separation enhances code maintainability and scalability.
 * 
 * 21. The Item class should produce the string describing the item because 
 * it contains the item's data and knows how to represent itself. 
 * The Room class should print this information since it contains the item and 
 * is responsible for describing everything present in the room.
 * 
 * 24. Test Case 1: Normal back Usage
 * "You go back to the outside the main entrance of the university."
 * Test Case 2: Incorrect back Usage (Second Word)
 * "I don't know what you mean..."
 * Test Case 3: back at the Starting Point
 * "You can't go back! This is your starting point."
 * Test Case 4: back After Moving
 * "You go back to the outside the main entrance of the university."
 * "You can't go back! This is your starting point."
 * .25. it won't work when you type back twice
